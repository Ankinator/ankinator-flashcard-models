Attackers, we\nshow, face this problem too. In deciding who to attack\ntrue positives are targets successfully attacked, while\nfalse positives are those that are attacked but yield\nnothing.\n\nThis allows us to view the attacker's problem as a\nbinary classification. ‘The most profitable strategy re-\nquires accurately distinguishing viable from non-viable\n‘users, and balancing the relative costs of true and false\npositives. We show that as vietim density decreases the\nfraction of viable users than can be profitably attacked\ndrops dramatically. For example, a 10x reduction in\ndensity can produce a 1000 reduction in the number\nof victims found. At very low victim densities the at-\ntacker faces a seemingly intractable Catch-22: unless he\ncan distinguish viable from non-viable users with great\naccuracy the attacker cannot find enough vietims to be\nprofitable, However, only by finding large numbers of\n\n‘victims can he lean how to accurately distinguish the\ntwo.\n\nFinally, this approach suggests an answer to the ques:\ntion in the title, Farefetched tales of West African riches\nstrike most as comical. Our analysis suggests that is an\nadvantage to the\n\n‘fect, ane the toe fae pte ati\n\nWhy do Nigerian Scammers Say They are from Nigeria?\n\nCormac Herley\nMicrosoft Research\n\nOne Microsoft Way\nRedmond, WA, USA\ncormac@microsoft.com\n\ncycles. ‘The mischief is not limited to computer secu-\nsity. Different fields have different names for the inher-\ncent trade-offs that classification brings. False alarms\ninst be balanced against misses in radar [22], precision\n‘against recall in information retrieval, Type I against\n‘Type Il errors in medicine and the fraud against the\ninsult rate in banking [19]. Common to all of these ar\nas is that one type of error must be traded off against\nthe other. The relative costs of false positives and false\nnegatives changes a great deal, so no single solution is\napplicable to all domains. Instead, the nature of the\nsolution chosen depends on the problem specifies. In\ndecisions on some types of surgery, for example, false\nPositives (unnecessary surgery) are preferable to false\nnegatives (necessary surgery not performed) since the\nlatter can be far worse than the former for the patient.\nAt the other extreme in deciding guilt in criminal cases\nit is often considered that false negatives (guilty per-\nson goes free) are more acceptable than false positives\n(innocent person sent to jail). In many domains de-\n‘termining to which of two classes something belongs is\n‘extremely hard, and errors of both kinds are inevitable.\nAttackers, we show, also face this trade-off problem.\nNot all targets are viable, i.\nattacked. For an attacke\n\nall yield gain when\n\nbalanced against false negatives, which are viable tar-\n«gets that go un-attacked. When attacking has non-zero.\ncost, attackers face the same difficult trade-off prob-\nlem that has vexed many fields. Attack effort must be\n\nspent carefully and too many misses renders the whole\nendeavor unprofitable.\n\n10\n"), (166, 'Scambaiting\r\n• Attacks the attackers!\r\n• Contact the attacker and involve \r\nhim/her into a conversation\r\n• Goal: Distract attacker \r\n• Some scambaiters lure scammers \r\ninto doing silly things\r\nSelected Topics in IT-Security\r\nProf. Dr. Frederik Armknecht - Chair of Computer Science IV \r\n11\r\nhttps://www.419eater.com/', "ol\ncas Gets UNIVERSITY\nScambaiting 9?

In versions prior to 2.2.0 any forum user can create a new thread/post with\nan include referencing a file local to the host operating system. Nimforum will render the file if able. This can also be done silently by using\nNimForum\'s post "preview" endpoint. Even if NimForum is running as a non-critical user, the forum.json secrets can be stolen. Version 2.2.0 of\nNimForum includes patches for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as is possible. There are no known workarounds for this\nissue.\n\nCVE-2022-23033 arm: guest_physmap_remove_page not removing the p2m mappings The functions to remove one or more entries from a guest p2m pagetable\non Arm (p2m_remove_mapping, guest_physmap_remove_page, and p2m_set_entry with mfn set to INVALID_MFN) do not actually clear the\npagetable entry if the entry doesn\'t have the valid bit set. It is possible to have a valid pagetable entry without the valid bit set when a guest\noperating system uses set/way cache maintenance instructions. For instance, a guest issuing a set/way cache maintenance instruction, then\ncalling the XENMEM_decrease_reservation hypercall to give back memory pages to Xen, might be able to retain access to those pages even\nafter Xen started reusing them for other purposes.\n\nCVE-2022-22945 VMware NSX Edge contains a CLI shell injection vulnerability.

Sourcegraph versions 3.35 and 3.36 reintroduced a previously fixed side-channel\nvulnerabilitity in the Code Monitoring feature where strings in private source code could be guessed by an authenticated but unauthorized actor.\nThis issue affects only the Code Monitoring feature, whereas CVE-2021-43823 also affected saved searches. A successful attack would require an\nauthenticated bad actor to create many Code Monitors to receive confirmation that a specific string exists. This could allow an attacker to guess\nformatted tokens in source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in versions 3.35.2 and 3.36.3 of Sourcegraph. Those who are unable to\nupgrade may disable the Code Monitor feature in their installation.\n\nCVE-2022-23304 The implementations of EAP-pwd in hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of\ncache access patterns. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-9495.\n\nCVE-2022-23303 The implementations of SAE in hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 are vulnerable to side channel attacks as a result of cache\naccess patterns. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-9494,\n\nCVE-2021-44421 The pointer-validation logic in util/mem_util.rs in Occlum before 0.26.0 for Intel SGX acts as a confused deputy that allows a local attacker to\naccess unauthorized information via side-channel analysis.\n\nCVE-2021-43823 Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph prior to version 3.33.2 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack where strings in\nprivate source code could be guessed by an authenticated but unauthorized actor. This issue affects the Saved Searches and Code Monitoring\nfeatures. A successful attack would require an authenticated bad actor to create many Saved Searches or Code Monitors to receive confirmation\nthat a specific string exists. This could allow an attacker to guess formatted tokens in source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in\nversion 3.33.2 and any future versions of Sourcegraph.

In this paper we present several weaknesses in the key schedul- Abstract. We demonstrate an active attack on the WEP protocol that\ning algorithm of RC4, and describe their cryptanalytic significance. We is able to recover a 104-bit WEP key using less than 40,000 frames with a\nidentify a large number of weak keys, in which knowledge of a small success probability of 50%. In order to succeed in 95% of all cases, 85,000\nnumber of key bits suffices to determine many state and output bits packets are needed. The IV of these packets can be randomly chosen. This\nwith non-negligible probability. We use these weak keys to construct is an im ment in the numb of requis fi by more than an\n\nnew distinguishers for\n\n" order of magnitude over the best known key-recovery attacks for WEP.\n\nOn a IEEE 802.1 1g network, the number of frames required can be ob-\ntained by re-injection in less than a minute. The required computational\nwith known IV modifie effort is approximately 27° RC4 key setups, which on current desktop\norder to encrypt different messages. Our new passive ciphertext-only at- and laptop CPUs is negligible.\n\ntack on this mode can recover an arbitrarily long key in a negligible\n\namount of time which grows only linearly with its size, both for 24 and\n\n128 bit IV modifiers.\n\nProf. Dr. Frederik Armknecht -

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online\npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a\nfinancial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main\nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending,\n‘We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network,\n‘The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of\nhhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing\nthe proof-of-work, The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of\nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.
